This repository shows my projects during the Data Science with Python course by Datacamp.
This course teaches how to import, clean, manipulate and visualize data, all skills for a data professional or researcher. It has hands-on projects with some of the most popular Python libraries, including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc. The projects has real-world datasets to learn the statistical and machine learning techniques to train decision trees and use natural language processing (NLP).

In this project, you’ll apply the skills you learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. You’ll press “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

You’ll also gain experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis. This will allow you to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots you create of the data. 

1. Loading your friend's data into a dictionary
2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies!
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Digging deeper
8. Marking non-feature films
9. Plotting with color!
10. What next?
