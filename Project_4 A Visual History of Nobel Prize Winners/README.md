Open source projects contain entire development histories, such as who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. 

In this project, I read in, cleaned up, and visualized the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). 

With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. The objective of this project is to find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.
